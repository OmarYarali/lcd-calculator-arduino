# Arduino Calculator with LCD

An Arduino project for a basic calculator using an LCD display


This project implements a simple calculator using an Arduino, an LCD, and serial input. It supports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, ^) and handles division by zero gracefully.


## Requirements
- Arduino board
- LCD display (16x2)
- LiquidCrystal library (included by default in Arduino IDE)
- Serial Monitor

## How to Use
1. Connect the LCD to your Arduino as per the pin configuration in the code.
2. Upload the code to your Arduino.
3. Open the Serial Monitor, enter two numbers, and then enter an arithmetic operator to perform the calculation.

## Features
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
- Displays the result on the LCD.
- Handles division by zero with an error message.
